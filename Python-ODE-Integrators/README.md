# Python ODE Integrators
This assignment introduce python ODE solvers. Using the new tool, simulate two planets orbiting a sun. 

## Objectives
Accomplish the following by Fri. Feb. 14, 2014. 

  1. Write the equations of motion for a two planet system
  2. Transform those equations of motion into a function that can be handled by the ODE solving machinery.
  3. Set the masses and initial conditions such that the system falls into stable orbits. 
  4. Have facilities that allow you to reason about the output.
  5. Write the equation for the energy of the system.
  6. This is the basis of the n-body problem . The simple loops over two planets here can be generalized to loops over many bodies.
